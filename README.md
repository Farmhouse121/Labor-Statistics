# Labor-Statistics
Briefly, these are scripts I've used historically to access data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
They are updated to Python 3, and the purpose is to load data into a MySQL database for further study.
Many BLS time-series are also imaged into the Fred repositories.

Both the `sql` and `src` folders have their own `README` files.
